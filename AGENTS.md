# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Relationship and Remotes

This local checkout is the **FOLIO/Alea downstream fork** of CatholicOS OntoKit API. It is
one working directory with two Git remotes, not a separate clone for each organization:

- `origin` — FOLIO/Alea downstream: `https://github.com/alea-institute/ontokit-api.git`
- `catholicos` — authoritative CatholicOS upstream:
  `https://github.com/CatholicOS/ontokit-api.git`

Agents should push FOLIO work and feature branches to `origin`. Treat `catholicos` as the
source for upstream changes; do not push to it unless the user explicitly requests that
specific action and confirms authorization. Before syncing or publishing, verify the
configuration with `git remote -v` rather than inferring a remote from the repository name.

To incorporate upstream changes into the downstream default branch, fetch `catholicos`,
fast-forward or merge its default branch into the local downstream branch as appropriate,
and then push the result to `origin`. Inspect branch names and divergence first; do not
assume both repositories currently use a branch named `main`.

### BAU Upstream Contribution Workflow

FOLIO/Alea is the working downstream where Damien builds features and fixes problems.
CatholicOS is the upstream project to which suitable improvements are proposed. The normal
business-as-usual correlation between them is:

1. Develop and validate the feature or fix in the FOLIO/Alea downstream repository.
2. Before opening an upstream PR, create an issue in the corresponding CatholicOS repository
   describing the problem, need, or desired feature to be solved. The issue establishes the
   upstream problem independently of FOLIO's implementation.
3. Open a CatholicOS PR as a **potential solution** to that issue, and explicitly link the PR
   to the issue. Do not present the downstream implementation as an assumed upstream decision.

Agents preparing CatholicOS contributions should preserve this issue-first ordering and the
problem/solution distinction. Do not open an upstream PR without first identifying or creating
its CatholicOS issue, unless the user explicitly directs otherwise.

## Project Overview

OntoKit API is a collaborative OWL ontology curation platform built with FastAPI (Python 3.11+). It provides a RESTful API for managing ontologies, semantic web knowledge graphs, and team collaboration with git-based version control. Distributed as the `ontokit` package on PyPI.

## Commands

### Development Server
```bash
uvicorn ontokit.main:app --reload
# Or using the installed CLI:
ontokit --reload
```

### Docker Compose (Full Stack)
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
ruff check ontokit/ --fix     # Lint with auto-fix
ruff format ontokit/          # Format code
```

### Type Checking
```bash
mypy ontokit/             # authoritative — gates CI & pre-commit
uv run pyright ontokit/   # advisory — non-gating CI job + IDE
```

**mypy is authoritative**: strict mode with the `pydantic.mypy` plugin, run in
pre-commit and the `lint` CI job — it is the only type checker that gates merges.
**pyright is advisory (soft-gated)**: a CI job that goes red on any error but is
**not** in the branch ruleset's required checks, so it surfaces problems without
hard-blocking merges (issue #134); it is also the default IDE checker. It catches
issues mypy misses (possibly-unbound vars, narrowing) but lacks mypy's plugin
coverage (Pydantic field typing), so when they disagree, mypy wins. Pyright only
recognizes keyword defaults — prefer `Field(default=None)` over `Field(None)` in
Pydantic schemas. Keep the `ontokit/` pyright run clean (0 errors).

### Security Scanning

CI runs `semgrep ci` (diff-aware against the PR baseline). For local one-shot
scans you have two options depending on whether you've signed up for Semgrep
Pro:

**With Pro entitlement** — runs the same engine as CI, including taint
analysis and the curated Pro rule pack. Mirrors what CI runs
(`.github/workflows/semgrep.yml`); `.semgrepignore` excludes are honored
automatically.

```bash
semgrep --pro \
  --config p/default \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/python \
  --config p/fastapi \
  --config p/jwt
```

**Without Pro (community fallback)** — drop `--pro`. You get the same rule
packs but only the OSS engine; some advanced cross-file taint findings won't
surface. Useful for forks and external contributors.

```bash
semgrep \
  --config p/default \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/python \
  --config p/fastapi \
  --config p/jwt
```

### Testing
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=ontokit                    # Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_health.py -v                 # Run single test file
pytest tests/ -k "test_name" -v                     # Run tests matching pattern
```

### Building & Publishing
```bash
uv build                           # Build sdist + wheel
uv run twine check --strict dist/* # Validate package
uv publish                         # Publish to PyPI
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head      # Apply all migrations
alembic downgrade -1      # Rollback one migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # Create new migration
```

### Release Management
```bash
python scripts/prepare-release.py        # Strip -dev suffix, commit
git tag -s ontokit-X.Y.Z               # Tag the release
git push --tags                          # Trigger CI/CD publish
python scripts/set-version.py X.Y.Z     # Set next dev version (adds -dev)
```

## Architecture

### Layer Structure
```
ontokit/
├── api/routes/       # REST endpoints (FastAPI routers)
├── services/         # Business logic layer
├── models/           # SQLAlchemy ORM models
├── schemas/          # Pydantic v2 request/response schemas
├── core/             # Config, database, auth infrastructure
├── git/              # Git repository management
├── collab/           # WebSocket real-time collaboration
├── version.py        # Version management (Weblate-style)
├── runner.py         # CLI entry point
└── worker.py         # ARQ background job queue
```

The URL prefix `/api/v1/` is preserved in `main.py` router registration — the version is a URL concern, not a directory concern.

### Key Services
- **ontology.py** - RDF/OWL graph operations using RDFLib and OWLReady2
- **linter.py** - Ontology validation with 20+ rule checks
- **pull_request_service.py** - Git-based PR workflow with diff generation
- **github_service.py** - GitHub App integration for syncing
- **project_service.py** - Project CRUD and member management

### Git Module (`ontokit/git/`)
The git module uses **pygit2 with bare repositories** for concurrent access:
- **bare_repository.py** - Core implementation using pygit2
  - `BareOntologyRepository` - Direct git object manipulation without working directory
  - `BareGitRepositoryService` - Service layer with backward-compatible API
- **repository.py** - Legacy GitPython implementation (deprecated)
- Bare repos allow multiple users to work on different branches simultaneously
- All file operations work directly on git blobs/trees, no checkout needed

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 (async via asyncpg + SQLAlchemy 2.0)
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis 7 (ARQ job queue, pub/sub)
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Auth**: Zitadel (OIDC/OAuth2 with JWT validation)
- **RDF**: RDFLib 7.1+ for graph manipulation
- **Git**: pygit2 with bare repositories for concurrent version control

### Key Patterns
- Async-first: All I/O uses async/await
- Dependency injection via FastAPI's `Depends()`
- Pydantic v2 for strict validation with computed fields
- Service singletons obtained via `get_service_name()` dependencies
- UTC timezone-aware datetime fields throughout

## Configuration

Environment variables are configured in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Key sections:
- Database: `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver)
- Auth: `ZITADEL_ISSUER`, `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID`, `ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Storage: `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`
- Git: `GIT_REPOS_BASE_PATH` for local repository storage

## Code Quality Settings

From pyproject.toml:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Ruff rules: E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP, ARG, SIM
- MyPy: Strict mode enabled, Python 3.11 target — authoritative, gates CI
- Pyright: standard mode, advisory soft-gate (CI job red on error, non-blocking);
  keep `ontokit/` at 0 errors. See Type Checking.

## Scripts

### Git Repository Migration
To migrate existing working-directory repositories to bare repositories:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py --dry-run  # Preview changes
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py            # Execute migration
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py --keep-old # Keep old repos after migration
```
