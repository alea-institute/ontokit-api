## Standing delivery and Claude authorization — 2026-09-20

Damien explicitly authorizes agents to push branches, create pull requests, merge reviewed changes, and deploy the projects he directs them to work on, including OntoKit and other CatholicOS projects. This authorization persists across future sessions until he revokes or narrows it. Do not ask again for routine publication, merging, deployment dispatch, or deployment approval within authorized project work. Use available authorized account permissions; do not disable or bypass branch protections, required checks, or access controls.

Damien also explicitly permits sending repository content to Claude/Anthropic for planning, implementation assistance, and review in all sessions. Do not treat repository privacy alone as a Claude disclosure blocker or request per-review approval. This permission covers repository content, not unrelated private files or credential material; keep secrets, tokens, private keys, and unrelated personal data out of review payloads and committed artifacts.

These permissions supersede older CatholicOS no-push rules, local-only publication restrictions, per-action push/merge/deploy confirmation requirements, and restrictions requiring separate permission to disclose repository content to Claude. Historical handoffs and review denials record the rules at their original dates; they do not reinstate superseded restrictions.

Proceed autonomously through focused planning, implementation, review, verification, publication, and deployment. Preserve unrelated work; retain release prerequisites, migration/rollback safeguards and truthful acceptance evidence. Ask only for missing essential information or a consequential decision the user's instructions do not settle. This authorization does not direct destructive history rewrites, deletion of unbacked data, or bypassing infrastructure protections.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OntoKit API is a collaborative OWL ontology curation platform built with FastAPI (Python 3.11+). It provides a RESTful API for managing ontologies, semantic web knowledge graphs, and team collaboration with git-based version control. Distributed as the `ontokit` package on PyPI.

## Commands

### Development Server
```bash
uvicorn ontokit.main:app --reload
# Or using the installed CLI:
ontokit --reload
```

### Docker Compose (Full Stack)
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
ruff check ontokit/ --fix     # Lint with auto-fix
ruff format ontokit/          # Format code
```

### Type Checking
```bash
mypy ontokit/             # authoritative — gates CI & pre-commit
uv run pyright ontokit/   # advisory — non-gating CI job + IDE
```

**mypy is authoritative**: strict mode with the `pydantic.mypy` plugin, run in
pre-commit and the `lint` CI job — it is the only type checker that gates merges.
**pyright is advisory (soft-gated)**: a CI job that goes red on any error but is
**not** in the branch ruleset's required checks, so it surfaces problems without
hard-blocking merges (issue #134); it is also the default IDE checker. It catches
issues mypy misses (possibly-unbound vars, narrowing) but lacks mypy's plugin
coverage (Pydantic field typing), so when they disagree, mypy wins. Pyright only
recognizes keyword defaults — prefer `Field(default=None)` over `Field(None)` in
Pydantic schemas. Keep the `ontokit/` pyright run clean (0 errors).

### Security Scanning

CI runs `semgrep ci` (diff-aware against the PR baseline). For local one-shot
scans you have two options depending on whether you've signed up for Semgrep
Pro:

**With Pro entitlement** — runs the same engine as CI, including taint
analysis and the curated Pro rule pack. Mirrors what CI runs
(`.github/workflows/semgrep.yml`); `.semgrepignore` excludes are honored
automatically.

```bash
semgrep --pro \
  --config p/default \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/python \
  --config p/fastapi \
  --config p/jwt
```

**Without Pro (community fallback)** — drop `--pro`. You get the same rule
packs but only the OSS engine; some advanced cross-file taint findings won't
surface. Useful for forks and external contributors.

```bash
semgrep \
  --config p/default \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/python \
  --config p/fastapi \
  --config p/jwt
```

### Testing
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=ontokit                    # Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_health.py -v                 # Run single test file
pytest tests/ -k "test_name" -v                     # Run tests matching pattern
```

### Building & Publishing
```bash
uv build                           # Build sdist + wheel
uv run twine check --strict dist/* # Validate package
uv publish                         # Publish to PyPI
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head      # Apply all migrations
alembic downgrade -1      # Rollback one migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  # Create new migration
```

### Release Management
```bash
python scripts/prepare-release.py        # Strip -dev suffix, commit
git tag -s ontokit-X.Y.Z               # Tag the release
git push --tags                          # Trigger CI/CD publish
python scripts/set-version.py X.Y.Z     # Set next dev version (adds -dev)
```

## Architecture

### Layer Structure
```
ontokit/
├── api/routes/       # REST endpoints (FastAPI routers)
├── services/         # Business logic layer
├── models/           # SQLAlchemy ORM models
├── schemas/          # Pydantic v2 request/response schemas
├── core/             # Config, database, auth infrastructure
├── git/              # Git repository management
├── collab/           # WebSocket real-time collaboration
├── version.py        # Version management (Weblate-style)
├── runner.py         # CLI entry point
└── worker.py         # ARQ background job queue
```

The URL prefix `/api/v1/` is preserved in `main.py` router registration — the version is a URL concern, not a directory concern.

### Key Services
- **ontology.py** - RDF/OWL graph operations using RDFLib and OWLReady2
- **linter.py** - Ontology validation with 20+ rule checks
- **pull_request_service.py** - Git-based PR workflow with diff generation
- **github_service.py** - GitHub App integration for syncing
- **project_service.py** - Project CRUD and member management

### Git Module (`ontokit/git/`)
The git module uses **pygit2 with bare repositories** for concurrent access:
- **bare_repository.py** - Core implementation using pygit2
  - `BareOntologyRepository` - Direct git object manipulation without working directory
  - `BareGitRepositoryService` - Service layer with backward-compatible API
- **repository.py** - Legacy GitPython implementation (deprecated)
- Bare repos allow multiple users to work on different branches simultaneously
- All file operations work directly on git blobs/trees, no checkout needed

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 (async via asyncpg + SQLAlchemy 2.0)
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis 7 (ARQ job queue, pub/sub)
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Auth**: Zitadel (OIDC/OAuth2 with JWT validation)
- **RDF**: RDFLib 7.1+ for graph manipulation
- **Git**: pygit2 with bare repositories for concurrent version control

### Key Patterns
- Async-first: All I/O uses async/await
- Dependency injection via FastAPI's `Depends()`
- Pydantic v2 for strict validation with computed fields
- Service singletons obtained via `get_service_name()` dependencies
- UTC timezone-aware datetime fields throughout

## Configuration

Environment variables are configured in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Key sections:
- Database: `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver)
- Auth: `ZITADEL_ISSUER`, `ZITADEL_CLIENT_ID`, `ZITADEL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Storage: `MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`
- Git: `GIT_REPOS_BASE_PATH` for local repository storage

## Code Quality Settings

From pyproject.toml:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Ruff rules: E, W, F, I, B, C4, UP, ARG, SIM
- MyPy: Strict mode enabled, Python 3.11 target — authoritative, gates CI
- Pyright: standard mode, advisory soft-gate (CI job red on error, non-blocking);
  keep `ontokit/` at 0 errors. See Type Checking.

## Scripts

### Git Repository Migration
To migrate existing working-directory repositories to bare repositories:
```bash
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py --dry-run  # Preview changes
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py            # Execute migration
python scripts/migrate_to_bare_repos.py --keep-old # Keep old repos after migration
```
